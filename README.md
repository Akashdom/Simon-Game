Start the game:
First, turn on the game. It consists of four colored buttons (red, blue, green, and yellow), each associated with a unique sound.

First sequence:
When the game starts, one button will light up and play its sound. You need to remember this sequence.

Repeat the sequence:
Once the button stops lighting up, you need to press the same button. If you press the correct button, the game will proceed to the next sequence.

Increase the sequence:
With each successful attempt, the game will add another button to the sequence, making it longer and more complex. You need to remember the new sequence and repeat it in the exact order.

On making a mistake:
If you press the wrong button, the game will play a "wrong" sound, and your game will end. Then you can reset the game and start over.
